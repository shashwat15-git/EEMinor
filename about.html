		<p class="content"> <img src="resources/eeebuilding.png" class="eeebud" style="float: right">The Department of Electrical and Electronics, is one of the oldest departments at R V College ofEngineering. Established in the year 1963, the department has well qualified; passionate and dedicated staff, most of who are engaged in path breaking research and development. With a current annual intake of 60 students from all parts of India, the staff to student ratio now stands at a plausible 1:13.
		<br><br>
		The Course at the department, is a healthy amalgam of Power Engineering, Electronics and Computers; comprehensive and in keeping modern trends of Electrical and Electronics Engineering education. Course pattern at the department is planned to keep the students up to date with the recent trends and shifting technological paradigms, making them industry ready. The course was accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA). The department has a total of 21 faculty members with various specializations, out of which 8 are PhD holders and all remaining 11 are pursuing PhD. The average experience of the faculty is very high. Students are required to undergo quizzes in addition to assignments and self study evaluation. They are evaluated on regular basis there by making the course learning and just not grade oriented.</p>
